## **IN PROGRESS**

## Overview

### Introduction

This project investigates methods for improving food safety using high energy light sterilization. 

https://abergel.lbl.gov/research/

### Results

Our expected results include designing an optimal UV lighting system to decontaminate surfaces as plants grow and configuring a system for X-ray irradiation of harvested foods for full volume decontamination. These systems will be integrated into the hydroponic indoor farming unit and harvesting workflow set up at UC Berkeley.
